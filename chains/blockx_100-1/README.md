## Register in the Genesis

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Registration has ended last January 5, 2024 üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è**. 

Interested Validators had to submit their gentx 

```sh
# Init node
blockxd init your-moniker --chain-id blockx_100-1

# Create keys, make sure that you store the generated mnemonics somewhere safe.
blockxd keys add your-key-name

# Set account necessary balance
blockxd add-genesis-account your-key-name 10000000000000000000000abcx
```

You can also edit the other values such as commission rate, website, contact and others.

```sh
# Create the gentx
blockxd gentx your-key-name 10000000000000000000000abcx \
  --node-id $(blockxd tendermint show-node-id) \
  --chain-id blockx_100-1 \
  --commission-rate 0.05 \
  --commission-max-rate 0.10 \
  --commission-max-change-rate 0.01 \
  --min-self-delegation 10000 \
  --website "https://blockxnet.com" \
  --details "My 1st Validator" \
  --identity "ABCDE12345" \
  --security-contact "contact@blockxnet.com"
```

You can use this nodes before as seeds to start the network. You can configure it under the config.toml file located in .blockxd/config folder

```sh
seeds="cd462b62d54296ab4550d7c1ed5baafe5653faa6@137.184.7.64:26656,82435c0df883bb8ae251182c81f5b7292f683e79@147.182.238.235:26656,5f21477b66cce124fc61167713243d8de30a9572@137.184.38.212:26656,abddf4491980d5e6c31b44e3640610c77d475d89@146.190.153.165:26656"

```

To start the chain:
1) Using your existing genesis file, edit the genesis_time to a future date. Your genesis file is located in /root/.blockxd/config. The genesis_time is the first line in the file.

```sh
"genesis_time": "2024-01-15T12:00:01Z",
```

2) After editing the genesis_time, run ./blockxd start in which will show something like this below
```sh
Genesis time is in the future. Sleeping until then... genTime=2024-01-15T12:00:01Z server=node
Starting pprof server laddr=localhost:6060 server=node

```

3) If you're able to run it without any errors, stop the blockxd then it is now time to copy the [genesis file](./genesis.json) in this repo. It is best to make a copy of your original genesis.json file before overwriting it.

4) Run the ./blockxd start command again which should again show something like this below

```sh
Genesis time is in the future. Sleeping until then... genTime=2024-01-15T12:00:01Z server=node
Starting pprof server laddr=localhost:6060 server=node

```

If you're still having errors, you can try deleting the data folder located in /root/.blockxd except for the file named priv_validator_state.json. Check the file as well if it is the same to something like this. If not, edit it accordingly.

```sh
{
  "height": "0",
  "round": 0,
  "step": 0
}
```

To verify that the genesis.json file is correct, 'shasum -a 256 genesis.json'
```sh
