## üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Want to become a validator?

Validators are responsible for securing the blockX network. Validator responsibilities include maintaining a functional [node](https://docs.blockxnet.com/validators) with constant uptime and providing a sufficient amount of $BCX as stake. In exchange for this service, validators receive block rewards and transaction fees!
